# Hamlet Script Bug Fixes

This is a Don't Starve mod that aims at fixing scripting errors in the Hamlet DLC.

## Features
Here is a list of changes made by this mod:

- Fixed hippopotamoose dropping aggro too early when using the leap attack;
- Fixed hippopotamoose's leap attack being interrupted when it crosses land/water boarder;
- Fixed platapine not spawned at the right position in some cases. It will now not spawn if no suitable spawn point is found;
- Fixed piko not getting stunned when dropped;
- Fixed piko looking for combat targets even when they're not rabid;
- Fixed an animation error of piko's burning and shatter FX;
- Fixed the respawn timer for piko using the wrong value. It is now 4 days instead of 10 seconds;
- Fixed the Pugalisk getting stuck in ground forever when it tries to taunt;
- Fixed snake not returning to its home when day comes in Hamlet-compatible worlds;
- Fixed the player not automatically leaving the work state while using the living artifact;
- Changed pangolden's stategraph name from "beefalo" to "pangolden";
